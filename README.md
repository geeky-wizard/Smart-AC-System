# Smart-AC-System

Smart AC System is designed and simulated on Proteus.

This system opens/closes four AC vents based upon the current
temperature in the Room. The temperature is maintained at a range of
16â€“35 oC. The AC vents can be gradually opened / closed. This is
done in accordance with the temperature in the room. The room is a
fairly large sized room so 4 temperature sensors are placed at different
points of the room. Each sensor and AC vent is associated with part of
the room. You can assume that the room is broken up into 4 sub-areas
each with its own sensor and ac vent.

User Interface: LCD displaying Temperature in 0oC. Single push button
to vary temperature between 16-35 degree celsius.

The duration for which the system is ON can be set by the user in
minutes ranging from 30 min. to 6 hours with a granularity of 30 min.
Once the defined time has elapsed, the vents are closed.

Assumptions and Instructions to run the code are given in the SmartAC-System.pdf file.
